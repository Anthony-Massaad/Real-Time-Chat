# Real Time Chat

## Description
This repository shows the implementation of a Real Time Chat using Ejs, JavaScript, and CSS. At the same time, the server is connected using sockets that allows one or more users to connect and message one another with whatever username they input in the login page. 

Quick Preview

Afterwards, the following dependencies are to be installed through the terminal:
```
npm install ejs express body-parser socket.io nodemon
```

Once everything is installed, run ```nodemon app.js``` or ```node app.js``` and go to ```http://localhost:3000/``` to enjoy the application!
